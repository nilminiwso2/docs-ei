# Capturing Change Data

Change Data Capture (CDC)involves tracking the changes made to data stored in a specific location (typically a database or a file) so that action can be taken based on the change.

WSO2 Streaming Integrator uses Siddhi extensions to read data from databases and files in real-time. This allows you to perform CDC operations, process the data captured and generate results, and act on these results in real-time.
