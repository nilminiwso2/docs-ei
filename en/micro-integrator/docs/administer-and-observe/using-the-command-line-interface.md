# Micro Integrator CLI

The Micro Integrator CLI allows you to monitor the synapse artifacts (deployed in a specified Micro Integrator server) from the command line. The CLI is an alternative to the [management dashboard](../../administer-and-observe/working-with-monitoring-dashboard), which provides a graphical view of the deployed artifacts.

The dashboard as well as the CLI communicates with the management API of WSO2 Micro Integrator to function. Therefore, be sure to [enable the Management API](#enable-the-management-api) in the server before using the dashboard or the CLI.

## Enable the Management API

To use the CLI tool, you need to enable the management API when you
start your WSO2 Micro Integrator instance. Pass the following system property:

```bash
-DenableManagementApi
```

-   When you run the Micro Integrator on Docker, start your Docker
    container by passing the `enableManagementApi` system property:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8290:8290 -p 9164:9164 -e JAVA_OPTS="-DenableManagementApi=true" <Docker_Image_Name>
    ```

    !!! Note
        -  The default address is **https://localhost** and the port is **9164**.
        -  You can change the default host and port of the dashboard by using the [remote](#commands) command.

-   When you run the Micro Integrator on a VM, use the following command
    to enable the `enableManagementApi` system property:

    ```bash
    sh micro-integrator.sh -DenableManagementApi
    ```

-   The Management API is enabled for the embedded Micro Integrator in WSO2 Integration Studio by default.

## Install and run the CLI

1.  To download the dashboard, go to [**WSO2 Micro Integrator** website](https://wso2.com/integration/micro-integrator/#) -> **Download** -> **Other Resources**, and click **CLI Tooling**.
2.  If you are using a UNIX-based operating system (Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X), be sure to set the `MI_CLI_HOME/bin` folder path as the PATH:

    ```
3.  Execute the following command to start the CLI:

    ```bash
    ./mi
