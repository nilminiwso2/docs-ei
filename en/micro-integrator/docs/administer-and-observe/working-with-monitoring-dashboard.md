# Micro Integrator Dashboard

The Micro Integrator dashboard provides a graphical view of the synapse artifacts that are deployed in a specified Micro Integrator server instance. You can also perform various management and administration tasks using the dashboard. The dashboard (as well as the [Micro Integrator CLI](../../administer-and-observe/using-the-command-line-interface)) communicates with the management API of WSO2 Micro Integrator to function.

You can use the dashboard to perform the following administration tasks related to your Micro Integrator deployment:

-   <b>View deployed artifacts</b>

    View details of the artifacts deployed in a Micro Integrator instance.

-   <b>Update deployed artifacts</b>

    You can activate/deactivate the following artifacts from the dashboard: <i>Proxy Services</i>, <i>Endpoints</i>, and <i>Message Processors</i>.

    You can enable/disable tracing and statistics for the following artifacts: <i>Proxy Services</i>, <i>Endpoints</i>, and <i>Message Processors</i>.

-   <b>View and update logs</b>

    You can view the log files generated for the Micro Integrator, download the log files, and also update loggers and log levels.

-   <b>Manage users</b>

    You can view details of users stored in the [external user store](../../setup/user_stores/managing_users). If you are logged in to the dashboard with administrator credentials, you can also add new users, and remove users from the user store.

## Setting up the Dashboard

-	See the following topics in the installation guide for instructions on how to install and set up the Micro Integrator and the Dashboard:

	<table>
	    <tr>
	        <td>
	            <a href="../../setup/installation/install_in_vm_installer">Using the Installer</a>
	        </td>
	        <td>
	            Download and run the <b>product installer</b> and then follow the instructions to start the Micro Integrator and the dashboard.
	        </td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>
	            <a href="../../setup/installation/install_in_vm_binary">Using the Binary</a>
	        </td>
	        <td>
	            Download the binary distribution of the product, and then follow the instructions to start the Micro Integrator and the dashabord.
	        </td>
	    </tr>
	</table>

-	Set up the [Micro Integrator user store](../../setup/user_stores/setting_up_a_userstore).

	!!! Tip
		Note the following about your user store configurations.

		-	The user credentials for signing in to the dashboard should be stored in your user store. This can be the default **file-based user store** or an **external LDAP/RDBMS** user store.
		-	[User management](../../setup/user_stores/managing_users) is possible only if you have an RDBMS or LDAP user store for your Micro Integrator.
		-	If you have an [external RDBMS user store](../../setup/user_stores/setting_up_a_userstore/#configuring-an-rdbms-user-store), be sure that the RDBMS driver is correctly added to the `<MI_HOME>/lib` folder. Without the driver, you will not be able to sign in.

## Signing in to the Dashboard

Once you [set up and start the dashboard](#setting-up-the-dashboard), you can access the dashboard URL.
  
1.  Copy the following dashboard URL to your browser:

    ```bash
    https://localhost:9743/dashboard/login
    ```

2.  Enter the following details to sign in.

                Host
            </th>
            <td>
                The host name for the running Micro Integrator instance. The default hostname is <b>localhost</b>.

            </th>
            <td>
                The port exposing the management API of your running Micro Integrator instance. The default HTTPS port is <b>9164</b>.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>

                The user name to sign in.</br></br>
                <b>Note</b>: This should be a valid user name that is saved in the Micro Integrator server's user store. See <a href="../../setup/user_stores/setting_up_a_userstore">configuring user stores</a> for information.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Password

    !!! Warning

        - In a non-production environment (with the self-signed certificate), you have to add the certificate of the micro integrator instance to the browser as a trusted source. For example, direct the browser to `https://localhost:9164/management` and add the site as trusted. This step will not be required with a custom production certificate.
        - We have identified issues with the Microsoft Edge browser, which prompts trusting the management URL (with the self-signed certificate) in a loop. Please try trusting the management URL in the same tab if you face this issue. If the issue still persists, consider switching the browser.

3.  Click <b>SIGN IN</b>.

You are redirected to the home page of the Micro Integrator dashboard.
