# Observability Solutions

This section explains how to set up the observability solutions for WSO2 Enterprise Integrator.

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator offers two observability solutions referred to as the classic observability deployment and cloud native observability deployment.

- **Classic Observability Deployment**

    This solution is more suitable in the following scenarios:
    
    - If you require more business analytics and less operation observability.
    
    - If you want a simpler deployment
    
    - If you already have an observability stack such as ELK

- **Cloud Native Observability Deployment**

    This solution is more suitable in the following scenarios:

    - If you are creating a new cloud native deployment
    
    - If you have Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger as you in-house monitoring and observability tools.
