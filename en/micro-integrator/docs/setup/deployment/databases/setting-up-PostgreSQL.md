# Setting up PostgreSQL

Given below are the steps you need to follow in order to use an PostgreSQl database for cluster coordination in a Micro Integrator cluster.

## Setting up the database and login role

Follow the steps below to set up a PostgreSQL database.

1.  Install PostgreSQL on your computer as follows:  
2.  Start the PostgreSQL service using the following command:  
3.  Create a database and the login role from a GUI using the
4.  To connect PGAdminIII to a PostgreSQL database server, locate the
    server from the object browser, right-click the client and click
    **Connect** . This will show you the databases, tablespaces, and
    login roles as follows:  
5.  To create a database, click **Databases** in the tree (inside the
    object browser), and click **New Database** .
6.  In the **New Database** dialog box, give a name to the database,
    e.g., gregdb and click **OK** .
7.  To create a login role, click **Login Roles** in the tree (inside
    the object browser), and click **New Login Role** . Enter the role
    name and a password.

    These values will be used in the product configurations as described
        in the following sections. In the sample configuration,
        `           gregadmin          ` will be used as both the role name
        and the password.

8.  Optionally, enter other policies, such as the expiration time for
    the login and the connection limit.
9.  Click **OK** to finish creating the login role.

## Setting up the drivers

1.  Download the [PostgreSQL JDBC4 driver](http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html).
2.  Copy the driver to the `MI_HOME/lib` directory.    

## Connecting the database to the server

Add the following parameters to the `deployment.toml` file in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory.

```toml
[[datasource]]
id = "WSO2_COORDINATION_DB"
url= "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/gregdb"
username="root"
password="root"
driver="org.postgresql.Driver"
pool_options.maxActive=50
pool_options.maxWait = 60000
pool_options.testOnBorrow = true
```
