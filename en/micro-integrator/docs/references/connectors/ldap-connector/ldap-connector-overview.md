# LDAP Connector Overview

The LDAP connector allows you to connect to any LDAP server through a simple web services interface and perform CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on LDAP entries. This connector uses the JAVA JNDI APIs to connect to a 
required LDAP server.

To see the available LDAP connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "LDAP".
