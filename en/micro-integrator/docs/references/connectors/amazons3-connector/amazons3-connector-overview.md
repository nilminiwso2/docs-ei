# Amazon S3 Connector Overview

Amazon S3 is a web-based storage service that can be used to store and retrieve data at anytime from anywhere on the web. Amazon uses the same service to run its own network that proves its scalability, reliability, and security.

The Amazon S3 Connector allows you to access the REST API of [Amazon Storage Service S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html), which lets you store your information and retrieve them back when needed. WSO2 EI AmazonS3 Connector is useful to take your on-premise data to the cloud. The advantage is, you do not need to worry about managing and replicating data on-premise.

To see the Amazon S3 connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "Amazon".
