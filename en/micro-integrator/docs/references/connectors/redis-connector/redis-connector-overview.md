# Redis Connector Overview

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a **cache** or a **database**, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperlogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

This connector enables developers to use an external Redis server as a cache or a database in the WSO2 EI mediation logic.

To see the available Redis connector, navigate to the [connector store](https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/list) and search for "Redis".
