# BigQuery Connector Overview

The BigQuery connector allows you to access the [BigQuery REST API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest) through WSO2 EI. BigQuery is a tool that allows you to execute SQL-like queries on large amounts of data at outstanding speeds. It is a serverless Software as a Service that supports querying using ANSI SQL.
